## Overview

Our goal is two rounds of research during this project:
- One round of individual interviews with the goal of discovering user needs at the beginning of the project to inform product and design decisions
- One round of interface testing with the goal of assessing our design's success at meeting user needs to inform improvements to the product and design

## Round One Research Goal and Plan: Discovery of User Needs

**Goal**
Speak to 3-5 Californians who might be affected by emergencies in their areas to learn about their current means of learning about emergencies, what doesn't work well about those for them, and what might work better to inform them.

**Research Questions**

- How do people currently get information about emergencies?
- Are there ways that notifications and messages could be changed to better inform them?
- What kinds of preferences do residents have about notifications they might receive?
- What kinds of emergency information are most useful to residents?

### Research Participant Recruitment

- Add details about screener survey and tool

### User Research Conversation Guide

#### Introduction

- Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Our goal of this conversation is to learn about how you find out about things going on in your area, especially emergency situations.
- I have a bunch of questions for you, but there are no right or wrong answers - we just want to learn from your experiences.
- My colleague (name) is on the call taking notes, and we'd like to record our voices in case we miss something. Is that okay with you?

#### Questions

- To start, can you tell me a little bit about your life in California?
- Have you heard about emergency situations in your area in the past six months?
 - What were they?
 - How did you hear about them?
- Have you signed up for any ways to get information about emergencies in your area?
 - Are there any ways you automatically get information about emergencies in your area?
 - What did you do when you heard?
 - Are there ways you tried to get more information? How?
- Are there any ways that finding out about emergencies hasnâ€™t quite worked for you?
 - How could those go better?
 - If you could wave a magic wand and change it, what would your ideal way to get this kind of information be?
 - What kind of things would it tell you?
 - How would it get to you?
 - What places would it tell you about things? (Where you are? Where loved ones are?)

#### Closing

- Thank you again for your time and for sharing with us.
- Do you have any questions for me?

### Findings

#### Next Steps

#### Make these updates to current designs

#### Follow up questions for stakeholders
